# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
-   Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-   Vue.js

### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice using Vue.js, as I've lately been learning it.
I learned a little bit more about how components works, some ways you can use vue for reactivity and in html templates ; as well as the public folder's reach while on a live website.

### Continued development

As I couldn't figure out how I was to integrate the way to open a question pressing Enter, I think I would have to focus a bit more on props and emits, maybe on some project structure or some thing I couldn't figure out this time that would have made it work.

### Useful resources

I mainly used the official documentation.
